# Design System Brief

This file is the source of truth for AI agents and humans when creating UI in this Starter.
Keep it updated before generating new screens with Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, v0, Open Design,
Figma MCP, Onlook, Scamp, or similar tools.

## Product Intent

This Starter should produce production-grade application interfaces, not generic demo pages.
Generated UI must feel domain-specific, accessible, responsive, and built from reusable components.

## Audience

- Developers starting new products from this monorepo.
- Designers or product builders using AI tools to explore screens.
- AI coding agents implementing UI from product briefs, Figma frames, or design-system prompts.

## Visual Principles

- Prefer clear hierarchy over decoration.
- Prefer operational density for dashboards, admin panels, and internal tools.
- Prefer calm, readable surfaces for documentation and product workflows.
- Avoid generic SaaS hero sections inside actual applications.
- Avoid decorative blobs, background glows, unnecessary nested cards, and one-note purple/blue gradients.
  Glass is an intentional `kind` described below, not a default page decoration.
- Use real state design: loading, empty, error, disabled, hover, focus-visible, selected, saving,
  success, and permission denied.

## Rabtx UI: shared design intent

This section records the owner's locked direction. Use it when another agent or session takes
on a component. Existing code is an implementation to assess, not proof that the design is finished.

### Direction (locked 2026-10-07)

`@rabtx/ui` is being rebuilt from scratch, one component at a time. It is not a styled layer over
shadcn and it does not inherit `@starter/ui`'s components.

- **Design source:** the Reptex/Grid design system in Figma (see Figma source below). Where this
  file and Figma disagree on a visual decision, Figma wins, with two exceptions: no shadows, and
  depth has two modes (Flat and Floating), not three. Record the component's Figma node ID on its
  card.
- **No animation library.** Motion is CSS only on the web (see Motion). Do not add `motion`,
  `framer-motion`, GSAP or similar. JavaScript may set state (an attribute, a CSS variable) but the
  animation itself lives in CSS.
- **shadcn is kept only for its CLI** (`components.json`, registry and add-component workflow). Its
  component code is not the foundation and is replaced component by component.
- **Tailwind CSS stays** as the styling system, on the shared tokens.
- **Icons are HugeIcons only** (`@hugeicons/react` on web, `@hugeicons/react-native` on native), at
  the sizes the design uses. `lucide-react`, `lucide-react-native` and any other icon set are not
  used.
- **Two targets, one design language:** web components and real React Native/Expo components that
  share tokens, spring parameters and design intent, but not rendering code.
- **Clean components:** a component carries no per-style branching. Radius and depth come from token
  modes, and each `kind` is a ready-made set of classes applied only when selected.
- **Playground:** `apps/web` at `/ui` is the playground that showcases `@rabtx/ui`. It is rebuilt
  fresh; the earlier shadcn lab and the docs `/rabtx` preview pages are deleted.
- **Animation reference:** beUI (`https://beui.dev`; MCP server `https://mcp.beui.dev/mcp`).

Tokens read from Figma so far, as a starting point; read each component's own variables before
building it:

- Names are `--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--size-*`.
- Radius 4, 6, 8, 12 and 999. Space 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32.
- Control height 24 (sm), 28 (md), 36 (xl), 44 (2xl) and 48 (3xl); nav row height 28.
- Type is SF Pro at 12/16, 13/20, 14/20 and 18/26 (regular 400, medium 510), letter spacing -0.15.
- Dark colors: surface `#212121`, subtle `#1b1b1b`, pressed `#303030`, border `#303030` and strong
  `#3d3d3d`; text `#ebebeb`, `#a3a3a3`, `#7f7f7f`; accent `#2d7cf6`; danger `#f0686d`.
- Light colors (Button section): app and surface `#ffffff`, inverse `#1b1b1b` (hover `#292929`),
  pressed `#f2f2f2`, selected `#ebebeb`, border `#f2f2f2` and strong `#e3e3e3`; text `#292929`,
  `#5d5d5d`, `#9e9e9e`, disabled `#a3a3a3`; accent `#2d7cf6` (hover `#1f66db`); danger `#e5484d`.
- Button (`5:6`) is a matrix of style by size by state (default, hover, pressed, disabled). Styles:
  black primary, blue accent, hairline secondary, secondary, ghost and danger. It repeats for two
  radius modes (default and fully round) and two depth modes.

### Dependency policy

The goal is a clean, modern implementation, not zero dependencies. Component libraries became the
default mainly to get accessibility and interaction behavior that native HTML lacked. Modern
browsers now provide much of it, so prefer the platform first.

1. **Platform first (web).** Reach for native HTML and CSS before any package: `<dialog>`, the
   Popover API, `<details>`, `inert`, CSS anchor positioning, `:focus-visible`, `:has()`,
   `@starting-style`, `@property`, `linear()` easing, View Transitions and
   `prefers-reduced-motion`. Check each feature against the browser baseline the product supports
   before using it, and note that baseline on the component.
2. **Accessibility is not optional.** Keyboard operation, focus management, roles, names and
   states must be at least as good as the library being replaced. Verify with the keyboard and a
   screen reader, not just by reading the markup.
3. **A dependency needs a written reason.** State the platform gap it fills (usually an accessible
   behavior the platform cannot yet do) and the condition under which it can be removed. Without
   that, do not add it. Animation is never a valid reason on the web.
4. **Native (Expo / React Native) follows the same rule**, but the platform surface is smaller, so
   some dependencies (Expo modules, gesture and animation runtime) are expected. Which animation
   runtime native uses is an open decision (see below); it must take the same spring parameters as
   the web.
5. **Remove, do not stack.** Replacing a dependency means deleting it and its imports in the same
   change, not running two systems side by side.

### Goal and scope

Web components must be responsive by default and work on desktop browsers. Mobile means real React
Native/Expo components, not just a narrow web layout. Share the design language and tokens; use
platform-specific rendering and interactions where needed. No separate desktop library is required
now.

Work on one component at a time. Keep the implementation minimal (KISS, DRY, Ponytail): every
wrapper, style, dependency and abstraction must solve a current need. “Minimal” does not mean
omitting accessibility, useful feedback or the detailing that defines the depth treatment.

### Radius, depth and kind

Components vary along independent axes: color role (`variant`), size, and the three below. The old
four materials (`solid`, `detail`, `glass`, `terminal`) no longer exist.

**Radius** has three modes: Sharp, Default and Round. The terminal look is the Sharp mode; a
monospace font is applied globally by the app, never by a component. Radius is tiered, so a mode can
round the things that should be round without over-rounding the things that hold text:

| Tier | Used for | Sharp | Default | Round |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| button | buttons (small size uses 6px in Default) | 2px | 8px | full |
| pill | tags, count badges | 2px | full | full |
| control | inputs, nav items, cards | 2px | 8px | 12px |
| item | menu and select options, checkboxes | 2px | 6px | 10px |
| box | dialogs, popovers, sheets | 4px | 12px | 20px |

Round must never turn a card or a select option into a near-capsule: only buttons and pills go fully round.
Default matches Figma's `--radius-sm/md/lg/full` (6, 8, 12, 999). Check every component in Round
with long text.

**Depth** has two modes, Flat and Floating. Figma also draws a middle "Raised" mode and draws depth
with drop shadows; the owner will update Figma, and until then do not copy either.

- **Flat** is one simple 1px border. No second edge, no ring, no gradient.
- **Floating** is the depth. It uses no cast or blurred shadows. A surface has a real 1px border
  painted with a vertical gradient (light top edge to dark bottom edge), a 1px hairline ring just
  outside it, and faint sheen (top) and shade (bottom) gradients inside. Inputs and tracks use the
  inverse (a recessed well: dark top edge, light bottom edge).

The edge must be a border, not an inset shadow line: inset lines are straight and get clipped by the
corner radius, which makes the highlight look cut. A gradient border follows the radius exactly.

```css
@property --fill { syntax: "<color>"; inherits: false; initial-value: transparent; }
/* mode switches the variables only; components never branch on depth */
[data-depth="flat"]     { --e-ring: transparent; --e-edge-a: var(--line); --e-edge-b: var(--line); --e-sheen: transparent; --e-shade: transparent; }
[data-depth="floating"] { --e-ring: rgb(0 0 0 / .6); --e-edge-a: rgb(255 255 255 / .18); --e-edge-b: rgb(0 0 0 / .4); --e-sheen: rgb(255 255 255 / .06); --e-shade: rgb(0 0 0 / .16); }

.depth {
	border: 1px solid transparent;
	background:
		linear-gradient(180deg, var(--e-sheen), transparent 40%, transparent 60%, var(--e-shade)) padding-box,
		linear-gradient(var(--fill), var(--fill)) padding-box,
		linear-gradient(180deg, var(--e-edge-a), var(--e-edge-b)) border-box;
	box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px var(--e-ring);
}
```

Colors inside gradients are registered with `@property` so they can transition. The values above are
the dark-theme values from the sales-crm reference; Light needs its own set. Overlays (dialogs,
popovers, sheets) separate with the same edge plus a dimmed backdrop, never a cast shadow.

**Kind.** Reserved for a treatment that needs its own look. Today only `glass`. Each kind is a
ready-made set of classes applied only when that kind is selected, so the component itself stays
free of per-kind logic. `glass` is deliberately simple; its exact look is open.

Radius and depth ship as token modes: CSS variables switched by `data-radius` and `data-depth` on a
container, so components do not need props for them.

Do not interpret polished as “add more shadows, glow or animation.”

### Motion and interaction

Motion is on by default, purposeful and restrained, and CSS only on the web. Press and release feel
responsive without moving surrounding layout. Respect reduced motion; a Motion off switch in the
playground must also leave every state visible. Disabled controls must not activate or animate as
enabled ones. Motion is never the only feedback channel.

- **Springs** are defined by stiffness, damping and mass, solved into a CSS `linear()` easing with
  the settle time as the duration. The same three numbers feed the native runtime. beUI values:

  | Use | Stiffness / damping / mass | Notes |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Press | 500 / 30 / 0.6 | scale 0.93 on press, about 280ms |
  | Tabs indicator | 245 / 36 / 1.2 | no overshoot, about 670ms |
  | Swap (icon, label, morph) | 460 / 30 / 1 | about 5% overshoot |
  | Switch thumb | 800 / 80 / 4 | squish to 0.9 |
  | Toast | 420 / 34 / 0.75 | in: y 22, scale 0.96, blur 10 |
  | Panel (dialog, sheet) | 420 / 40 / 0.5 | exit shorter than enter |

  Springs given as duration and bounce convert as stiffness = (2π / duration)² and damping ratio =
  1 minus bounce.
- **State changes** (hover, focus, selected) use `cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1)` for about 150ms.
  High-frequency interactions (row hover, tab switch, keystrokes) get instant or near-instant
  feedback.
- **Icon and label swaps** cross-fade with scale 0.25 to 1, opacity and 4px blur over 300ms
  (`cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1)`). Exits are shorter than enters.
- **Limits:** a `linear()` spring is a fixed curve. If interrupted it restarts from the current value
  with no velocity carried over, and its duration does not depend on distance. Drag, swipe and
  momentum need JavaScript; the tooltip "warm window" does too. View Transitions snapshot the
  element, so a shared-element morph is a picture while it moves. Where one real element can morph
  by itself (width, height, radius, fill), prefer that.

Review default, hover (web), keyboard focus, pressed, disabled, loading and success states where
applicable. Include leading and trailing icons and icon-only examples with accessible names. Keep
labels and dimensions stable during state changes.

### Open decisions

These are not settled; do not guess them.

- **Native motion runtime.** Whether `react-native-reanimated` is acceptable or the built-in
  `Animated` API is used. Either way it takes the same spring parameters as the web.
- **Glass.** How far it goes (translucency plus blur, or closer to Apple's liquid glass).
- What `@starter/ui` becomes once components are rebuilt (tokens and CLI config only, or removed).
- Whether both light and dark themes ship in the first pass (Figma shows both).
- Mapping Figma's token names (`--color-*`, `--space-*`, `--radius-*`, `--size-*`) onto the existing
  shadcn names in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`.
- Font. Figma uses SF Pro, which exists only on Apple platforms; the web and Android fallback is
  undecided. A global monospace option is app-level theming, not a component concern.
- The order after Button. Button is first.

### Consistency and review

The same language applies to cards, inputs, sidebar items and the surrounding application shell. Use
semantic color and helpful SVGs where they clarify content, without decorative color noise. Do not
redesign every screen as part of a single component task.

Before moving to the next component, review the current one in the playground across Flat and
Floating, Sharp, Default and Round, Motion on and off, light and dark, every size and state, and long
text. Be explicit about untested native behavior and simplified glass fallbacks.

### Current implementation and preview

State as of 2026-10-07. Verify against the repo before relying on it.

- `packages/ui` (`@starter/ui`): the original shadcn-style web components (about 30), `motion/*`
  variants and `mobile/*` components, plus the shared tokens. The apps still consume it. It is the
  thing being replaced, not the foundation to extend.
- `packages/rabtx` (`@rabtx/ui`): the rebuild target. Built so far: the tokens and modes
  (`src/styles/tokens.css`), the spring solver (`src/motion`, generated `springs.css`) and **Button**.
  Styling is Tailwind first: `src/styles/control.css` holds the shared depth recipe (`rx-control`),
  the five tones (`rx-primary`, `rx-secondary`, `rx-ghost`, `rx-accent`, `rx-danger`) and the flat
  and motion-off rules; `src/button/button.styles.ts` holds the Button as Tailwind class strings
  (`buttonClass`, `buttonParts`) with no framework code; `button.tsx` is a thin React wrapper.
  Exports: `@rabtx/ui/button`, `@rabtx/ui/button/styles`, `@rabtx/ui/input`,
  `@rabtx/ui/input/styles`, `@rabtx/ui/field`, `@rabtx/ui/field/styles`, `@rabtx/ui/textarea`,
  `@rabtx/ui/textarea/styles`, `@rabtx/ui/card`, `@rabtx/ui/card/styles`, `@rabtx/ui/badge`, `@rabtx/ui/badge/styles`,
  `@rabtx/ui/select`, `@rabtx/ui/select/styles`, `@rabtx/ui/motion`, `@rabtx/ui/styles.css`.
- **Input** (Figma `6:14`): a wrapper draws the field (`rx-control rx-field`) around a native
  `<input>`. Heights 28, 32 (default), 36, 44, 48. Depth: Flat is one 1px border; Floating is a
  recess (dark top edge fading to a light bottom edge plus a faint top shade), which replaces
  Figma's inner shadow because depth has no cast or inset shadows. Focus is a blue edge plus a 3px
  halo; error (`aria-invalid`) is red the same way. Pill is a per-input `pill` prop (Figma's Shape
  property), independent of the Round radius mode, so text is never clipped. Dark field values and
  the 20% / 18% halo strengths are derived, not read from Figma. Figma's placeholder color
  (`#9e9e9e` on `#f5f5f5`) is below 4.5:1; kept as specified, flagged for the design owner.
- **Field** (Figma `26:436`): a label (13/20 medium), one control and an optional 12/16 hint, 6px
  apart. It owns the wiring: a generated `id` for the label, the hint or error linked with
  `aria-describedby`, `aria-invalid` on an error, and a polite live region for the message. The
  control reads this from a React context, so Textarea and Select can join it later. The context is
  internal (not exported) so server files can import `@rabtx/ui/field`. The hint (`#9e9e9e`) and
  error (`#e5484d`) text colors are as specified and are below 4.5:1 on white; flagged.
- **Textarea** (Figma `66:783`): the `<textarea>` itself is the field (`rx-control rx-field`, no
  wrapper), 96px minimum height, 13/20 text, vertical resize, and it reads Field's context like
  Input. **Open inconsistency in Figma:** Textarea is drawn white with a plain border and no recess,
  while Input is `#f5f5f5` with a recess. Textarea follows Input so a form does not mix two field
  looks; if the owner wants it white, change its fill token only. Its focus (`#d3e4fd`) and error
  (`#fdecec`) halos are measured from Figma; Input's error halo was corrected to match (10%).
- **Card**: Figma has no generic Card section, so this is the container shared by its Kanban (12px
  padding), Option (16) and Stat (20) cards: surface fill, 1px `#f2f2f2` border, the box radius tier
  (12 Default, 20 Round, 4 Sharp), a vertical stack. One component, `padding` sm, md (default) or
  lg, an `as` tag for semantics, and `cardParts` text styles instead of header and footer parts.
  Floating uses the raised-surface edge and ring (as the secondary Button); Figma's cast shadow is
  dropped. `rx-surface` was split out of `rx-control` so a card is the plain surface with no hover or
  press. Deviation: the description uses the secondary gray (passes 4.5:1) where Figma's Option Card
  uses the tertiary gray; flagged. Option Card (selectable) and Stat Card are separate components.
- **Badge** (Figma `6:116`): 20px, 12/16 medium, a pale tint with colored text, six tones (neutral,
  accent, success, warning, danger, violet), optional 6px dot. Radius is its own tier,
  `--rx-r-badge`: 4px Default (Figma), 2px Sharp, fully round in Round. One `--tone` color per
  class drives both the fill (12% of the tone over the surface, which reproduces Figma's tints) and
  the ink. **Deviation, tested:** Figma's raw tone text (for example `#f0803c` on `#fef0e6`) is
  2.7 to 3.9:1, below 4.5:1 for 12px text, so the ink is the tone mixed 75% toward black (toward
  white in dark). Measured: light 4.86 (warning) to 6.8, dark 5.07 to 6.6, asserted in
  `ui-badge.spec.ts`. Success, warning and violet reuse the same base color in dark; their dark
  values are not in Figma. Tag (outlined, `42:441`) and Chip (interactive, `6:139`) are separate.
- **Select** (Figma `66:770`, the trigger; the list follows Menu `7:91` and Menu Item `7:60`): a
  native `<select>` inside a field wrapper (`rx-control rx-field`), sizes 28, 32 (default), 36, 13/20
  text, optional leading icon, a `placeholder` (a hidden first option) and the same focus, error and
  disabled treatment as Input. The platform does the hard parts: keyboard, typeahead, screen readers,
  mobile pickers. Where `appearance: base-select` exists (Chromium) the list is styled to Menu: surface
  fill, hairline border, box radius, 28px rows, item radius, hover on `--rx-selected`, a blue tick on
  the chosen row, and a 150ms fade (off with Motion off). Elsewhere the OS list opens and the closed
  field looks the same. Floating uses a hairline ring on the list instead of Menu's cast shadow.
  **Notes:** Figma draws the Select trigger white and plain, like Textarea; it follows Input
  (see Textarea, same open question). Figma's `Value` text is the primary color even for "Select an
  option"; an unchosen placeholder is the tertiary gray here, as in Input. The chevron is HugeIcons'
  unfold-more glyph (MIT) inlined, so the package needs no icon set. Menu itself (a general popover
  menu, not tied to a select) is a separate component. Lightning CSS rejects
  `::picker(select):popover-open`; use `:open::picker(select)`.
  Dark values are derived from the dark Sidebar and are not yet confirmed in Figma.
- Other frameworks: a Solid component is another thin wrapper over `button.styles.ts` plus the same
  CSS, not a clone or a rewrite. Not built yet; add it as a separate package or export with
  `solid-js` as a peer dependency, and test it with a real Solid render.
- Docs: `apps/web` at `/ui`, in the style of shadcn and beUI: one page per component with a short
  intro, a few important live examples (each one's source is read from its file, so it cannot
  drift), an API table and accessibility notes. A header toggle sets `data-theme`, `data-depth`,
  `data-radius` and `data-motion`. Add examples only when they teach something new. E2E:
  `apps/web/e2e/ui-button.spec.ts`. One component at a time; the owner picks the next.
- Icons: HugeIcons is the target, but 44 files still import `lucide` and 93 import HugeIcons.
  Migrating the remaining lucide usage is part of the rebuild.
- Glass: the earlier web implementation was translucency plus backdrop blur and the native one was
  flat translucency; neither was liquid glass. On native the intended path is `expo-glass-effect`,
  already a mobile dependency, which hands the real system material to iOS instead of imitating it.
  The web has no equivalent system material, so it has to be approximated. Treat web and native
  results as the same material with different fidelity, and say which one you tested.
- Reference: `kargulstudio/sales-crm` (public, MIT) shows the depth technique and the app density we
  are targeting. Read it, do not copy its libraries.

## Layout Rules

- Use stable dimensions for toolbars, sidebars, tables, cards, and repeated controls.
- Do not let text overflow buttons, tabs, cards, table cells, or mobile headers.
- Do not place cards inside cards unless it is a true repeated item or modal body.
- Keep desktop workflows scannable and mobile workflows thumb-friendly.
- Use responsive constraints instead of viewport-scaled font sizes.

## Tokens

The shared Tailwind 4 design tokens live at `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css` (shadcn monorepo style).

Current baseline:

- Background: `--background`
- Foreground: `--foreground`
- Primary: `--primary`
- Secondary: `--secondary`
- Muted: `--muted`
- Border: `--border`
- Ring: `--ring`
- Radius: `--radius`
- Charts: `--chart-1` through `--chart-5`
- Sidebar tokens: `--sidebar-*`

When adding a new app, do not invent one-off color systems. Extend the shared token package or
create an app-specific override with a short rationale.

## Typography

- Use the app's configured sans font for product UI.
- Reserve large display text for true first-viewport marketing or documentation hero sections.
- Use smaller, tighter headings inside dashboards, cards, sidebars, tables, and forms.
- Keep letter spacing at `0` unless a specific brand treatment requires otherwise.

## Components

The repo has a shared web primitive package at `packages/ui` and app-local primitives in
`apps/web/src/components/ui`.

Current rule (during the rebuild):

- Existing screens keep using `@starter/ui` until the matching `@rabtx/ui` component exists. Do not
  add new components or features to `@starter/ui`.
- New and rebuilt components go in `@rabtx/ui`, one at a time, following the Direction and
  Dependency policy above. Do not wrap or extend a shadcn component.
- When a component is rebuilt, switch its consumers over and delete the `@starter/ui` original in
  the same change.
- Keep complex or app-specific composed components inside each app or feature module.
- Promote a component to `packages/ui` only after it is reusable and free of route/auth/data
  coupling.
- Extend the existing `/rabtx` docs routes for visual review of the polished components.
- Add examples for loading, empty, error, disabled, hover, focus-visible, and selected states.

## AI UI Generation Rules

Before implementing UI, an agent should:

1. Read this `DESIGN.md`.
2. Read the target app's README and existing components.
3. Identify reusable components and tokens.
4. Ask for missing product context if the screen purpose is unclear.
5. Propose an implementation plan before editing.

After implementing UI, an agent should:

1. Run lint/typecheck/tests for the touched app.
2. Capture or inspect desktop and mobile rendering where possible.
3. Check long text, empty data, error states, and keyboard focus.
4. List any intentional differences from the design reference.

## Prompt Template
